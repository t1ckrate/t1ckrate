# Thomas PERROT - @t1ckrate

Hello ! I'm Thomas, a young developer and sysadmin, currently working for https://elity.fr. :smile:
I'm a fan of new technologies and i love build thing by myself.

### Projects

I'm working for Elity as administrator and developer. Elity is a Minecraft Server, played by many thousands of players. :collision:
This project and many others are detailled on my website (https://t1ckrate.fr/#portfolio)

### Knowledges

* **Java is my main language**

I've also used others for personal projects:
  * Python
  * C++
  * PHP

I'm also praticing electronics, so i've achievied some projects using this.
Once again, everything is detailled on my [Website](https://t1ckrate.fr) !

### What's on my GitHub ?

I'll try to upload my personal projects on my GitHub. As a young developer and a perfectionnist, i'm not comfortable about sharing a code that i always find ugly ðŸ¥²
As the months go by, I'm getting better and I'm starting to be proud of my codes. :dizzy:
